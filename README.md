Tape Equilibrium problem.

Array of N integers A represents numbers on a tape. 

Any integer P such that 0 < P < N splits the tape into two non-empty parts (split the array into two): 
A[0], A[1], ..., A[P-1]
A[P], A[P+1], ..., A[N - 1] 

The difference between the two parts is defined as the absolute difference between the sums of the elements of the two parts. 

Given a non-empty array, return the minimal difference that can be achieved by splitting the array at point P.
